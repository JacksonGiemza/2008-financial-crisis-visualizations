# Visualizing the 2008 Financial Crisis

[Final ArcGis Story Map](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/3927d1b824094b6194fabebeb47d2ce3)

Our vision for this project was to create a dashboard that could teach the average person a bit about the financial crisis of 2008, and the effects it had on the U.S economy. To accomplish this, we retrieved and analyzed economic data from the FRED (Federal Reserve [of] Economic Data), and used that data to construct 4 visualizations in order to help visualize the effects. With several interactive visualizations that allow the user to explore the data over time on their own. While the 2008 crisis had many moving parts and a cascade of downstream effects, we decided to focus on the simpler concepts that people were more likely to recognize and relate to.
